> **‚ö†Ô∏è SECURITY WARNING**: This project is in active development and is **NOT PRODUCTION READY**. A comprehensive security audit identified 30 vulnerabilities - the **3 CRITICAL issues have been FIXED** in v0.1.0, but HIGH priority issues remain. Use with caution. See [docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md) for details.

## Overview

Easy Git simplifies managing projects with multiple nested git repositories by providing a unified interface for viewing status, committing changes, and performing batch operations across all repositories simultaneously.

### Why Easy Git?

Traditional git tools require managing each repository individually, making it painful to work with monorepos or projects with multiple sub-repositories. Easy Git provides:

- **Unified Dashboard**: View all repositories in a single interface
- **Batch Operations**: Commit, push, pull across multiple repos at once
- **Visual Status**: Instant overview of which repos need attention
- **High Performance**: Rust-powered parallel processing for fast scanning
- **Native Desktop**: First-class desktop experience with system integration

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install Flutter dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run the application
flutter run -d macos
```

**First-time setup**: See [Development](#development) section for prerequisites.

## Features

### ‚úÖ Implemented
- **Repository Discovery**: Parallel recursive scanning for nested git repositories
- **Status Overview**: Uncommitted changes, untracked files, ahead/behind counts
- **Branch Display**: Current branch for each repository
- **Commit History**: View last commit with timestamp
- **Batch Commit**: Commit to multiple repositories simultaneously
- **Batch Push/Pull**: Synchronize multiple repositories
- **Material Design 3 UI**: Modern, adaptive interface with dark/light themes
- **Real-time Refresh**: Update repository status on demand
- **Selective Operations**: Choose which repositories to operate on

### üöß In Progress
- **Security Hardening**: Fixing 30 identified vulnerabilities (3 CRITICAL)
- **Test Coverage**: Currently ~5% (10 Flutter tests, 0 Rust tests) - targeting 70%+ for v1.0
- **Code Quality**: Addressing 10 critical code issues
- **Essential Features**: Implementing diff viewer (BLOCKER for production)

### üìã Planned (v0.2.0+)
- Repository details screen with full file diff viewer
- Branch management (create, switch, delete)
- Stash operations
- Git history viewer
- Merge conflict resolution UI
- SSH key management
- Windows and Linux support

## How to Use

1. **Launch the app**: `flutter run -d macos`
2. **Click "Open Folder"**: Choose a directory with git repositories
3. **View Status**: See all nested repos with their current status
4. **Refresh**: Update repository information anytime

## Architecture

Easy Git uses a **Clean Architecture** approach with clear separation between Rust backend and Flutter frontend:

### Rust Core (Backend)
- **git2** (0.20): All git operations via libgit2
- **tokio** (1.47): Async runtime for I/O operations
- **rayon** (1.11): Parallel repository scanning and batch operations
- **thiserror** (2.0): Structured error handling
- **flutter_rust_bridge** (2.11.1): Type-safe FFI boundary

### Flutter UI (Frontend)
- **flutter_riverpod** (2.6.1): Reactive state management
- **freezed** (2.5.8): Immutable data models
- **go_router** (14.6.2): Declarative routing
- **flutter_hooks** (0.20.5): React-style composition
- **Material Design 3**: Adaptive theming system

```

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Rust handles ALL git operations for performance and safety
- Flutter is UI-only, no business logic
- Riverpod providers bridge Rust async operations to reactive UI
- Generated code excluded from version control

See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for detailed technical architecture.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- **Flutter SDK**: 3.35.4 or higher ([Install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install))
- **Rust Toolchain**: 1.89.0 or higher ([Install Rust](https://rustup.rs/))
- **Xcode Command Line Tools** (macOS): `xcode-select --install`
- **Git**: 2.0+ (should be pre-installed on macOS)

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/easy_git.git
cd easy_git

# Install Flutter dependencies
flutter pub get

# Verify Rust toolchain
cargo --version

# Run the app
flutter run -d macos
```

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Run app in debug mode
flutter run -d macos

# Run tests (Rust)
cargo test --manifest-path=rust/Cargo.toml

# Run tests (Flutter)
flutter test

# Code quality checks
flutter analyze                              # Dart linting
cargo clippy --manifest-path=rust/Cargo.toml # Rust linting
cargo check --manifest-path=rust/Cargo.toml  # Rust type checking

# Format code
dart format lib/ test/
cargo fmt --manifest-path=rust/Cargo.toml

# Clean build artifacts
flutter clean
cargo clean --manifest-path=rust/Cargo.toml
```

### Code Generation

When modifying Rust FFI functions or adding new ones:

```bash
# Regenerate Rust ‚Üî Flutter bindings
flutter_rust_bridge_codegen generate

# This updates:
# - lib/src/rust/api/*.dart
# - lib/src/rust/frb_generated.dart
# - rust/src/frb_generated.rs
```

When modifying Riverpod providers or Freezed models:

```bash
# Regenerate Dart code
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

### Project Conventions

- **NO comments** in code (self-documenting code preferred)
- **NO unwrap()/expect()** in Rust code (use `?` or pattern matching)
- Use `const` constructors wherever possible in Flutter
- Prefix unused variables with `_`
- Expression bodies (`=> expr`) for single-line functions
- All Rust code must pass clippy with zero warnings

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails with "Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64"

This is fixed by the `.cargo/config.toml` file which links zlib and iconv. If you still have issues:

```bash
# Clean and rebuild
flutter clean
flutter run -d macos
```

### No Repositories Found
- Ensure the selected directory contains `.git` folders
- Check repositories aren't too deeply nested
- Verify git is initialized in those directories
